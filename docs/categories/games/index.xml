    <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been following the Rust Roguelike Tutorial to build a little Rogue-like with an ECS core. I only got partway through, but it was a fun, focused project and I now have a playable build running in the browser.</p>
<p>Try it here: <a href="/games/rogue/" rel="">Rogue</a>.</p>
<h4 id="what-i-built-so-far" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#what-i-built-so-far" class="header-mark"></a>What I built so far</h4><p>It is a classic tile-based dungeon crawl with keyboard controls (arrow keys, vi keys, and numpad). The Rust core uses <code>specs</code> for ECS and <code>bracket-lib</code> for the terminal style rendering model. I bridged it to the browser with <code>wasm-bindgen</code>, so it runs as a WebGL canvas.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Building a Sudoku Editor with GPT-5.2</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I wanted a Sudoku editor that feels like a quiet desk: place numbers, track candidates, get nudges, and keep the board readable. So I built one with GPT-5.2 helping me iterate the UI and logic.</p>
<p>You can try it here: <a href="/games/sudoku/" rel="">Sudoku Editor</a>.</p>
<h4 id="what-it-does" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#what-it-does" class="header-mark"></a>What it does</h4><ul>
<li>9x9 editor with keyboard navigation, input validation, and clear visual feedback.</li>
<li>Candidate mode with a manual pencil-mark layer, plus optional auto-candidates.</li>
<li>Generator with difficulty targets (easy/medium/hard) and uniqueness checks.</li>
<li>Step solver with hints and a log that explains the tactic used.</li>
<li>Quality-of-life actions: New, Reset, Undo, Copy, Load.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-bits-i-like" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-bits-i-like" class="header-mark"></a>The bits I like</h4><ul>
<li>The board reacts quickly. It highlights row/column/box, matches values, and invalid cells without feeling noisy.</li>
<li>The candidate system has two layers: manual marks you place and auto-candidates the solver derives. You can flip between them without losing your notes.</li>
<li>The step solver does not just fill cells; it shows the reasoning and keeps a trail so you can walk back through the tactics.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-the-solver-thinks" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#how-the-solver-thinks" class="header-mark"></a>How the solver thinks</h4><p>The solver starts with the basics (naked and hidden singles), then escalates through sets, pointing/claiming, fish, and wing tactics. I wanted the hints to be helpful rather than magical, so each step reports the evidence in plain language.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Porting Asteroids to an ECS with Codex</title>
    <link>https://secretdeveloper.github.io/blog/2025-10-01-porting-asteroids-to-an-ecs-with-codex/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Quick version: I rewired my <a href="/games/asteroids/" rel="">Asteroids</a> clone from a pile of classes to an Entity‑Component‑System (ECS). Codex (the CLI agent) did the heavy lifting while I poked, prodded, and occasionally muttered at my screen. The end result is cleaner, easier to extend, and less brittle when I add toys like missiles and sparkly shields.</p>
<p>Why bother with ECS?</p>
<ul>
<li>I was done fighting class hierarchies. I just want to slap “has a shield,” “spins,” or “is a missile” onto things without negotiating with a base class.</li>
<li>Data is data, behavior is behavior. Components hold state; systems do the work over sets of components.</li>
<li>(maybe) Performance as a side effect: tight loops over similar data are fast, but honestly the clarity is what sold me.</li>
<li>New features become “add a component, tweak a system,” not surgery across five files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where I started (a.k.a. the creaky bits)</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this post I explore how to use <strong>gpt-oss-20b</strong>, an open source 20-billion parameter language model, to prototype two classic browser games: Asteroids and Breakout. By iterating on prompts and refining the output, I generated working HTML5 Canvas implementations in around an hour or so.</p>
<h4 id="about-gpt-oss-20b" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#about-gpt-oss-20b" class="header-mark"></a>About gpt-oss-20b</h4><p>gpt-oss-20b is an open-source 20-billion parameter transformer-based language model released by OpenAI under the Apache 2.0 license. It is based on the GPT-4 architecture scaled to 20B parameters, trained on a diverse mix of web text, code, and documents.</p>]]></description>
