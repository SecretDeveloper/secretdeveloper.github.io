    <description><![CDATA[<p>Quick version: I rewired my <a href="/games/asteroids/" rel="">Asteroids</a> clone from a pile of classes to an Entity‑Component‑System (ECS). Codex (the CLI agent) did the heavy lifting while I poked, prodded, and occasionally muttered at my screen. The end result is cleaner, easier to extend, and less brittle when I add toys like missiles and sparkly shields.</p>
<p>Why bother with ECS?</p>
<ul>
<li>I was done fighting class hierarchies. I just want to slap “has a shield,” “spins,” or “is a missile” onto things without negotiating with a base class.</li>
<li>Data is data, behavior is behavior. Components hold state; systems do the work over sets of components.</li>
<li>(maybe) Performance as a side effect: tight loops over similar data are fast, but honestly the clarity is what sold me.</li>
<li>New features become “add a component, tweak a system,” not surgery across five files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where I started (a.k.a. the creaky bits)</p>]]></description>
