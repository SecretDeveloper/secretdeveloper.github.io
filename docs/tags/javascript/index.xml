    <description><![CDATA[<p>I wanted a Sudoku editor that feels like a quiet desk: place numbers, track candidates, get nudges, and keep the board readable. So I built one with GPT-5.2 helping me iterate the UI and logic.</p>
<p>You can try it here: <a href="/games/sudoku/" rel="">Sudoku Editor</a>.</p>
<h4 id="what-it-does" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#what-it-does" class="header-mark"></a>What it does</h4><ul>
<li>9x9 editor with keyboard navigation, input validation, and clear visual feedback.</li>
<li>Candidate mode with a manual pencil-mark layer, plus optional auto-candidates.</li>
<li>Generator with difficulty targets (easy/medium/hard) and uniqueness checks.</li>
<li>Step solver with hints and a log that explains the tactic used.</li>
<li>Quality-of-life actions: New, Reset, Undo, Copy, Load.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-bits-i-like" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-bits-i-like" class="header-mark"></a>The bits I like</h4><ul>
<li>The board reacts quickly. It highlights row/column/box, matches values, and invalid cells without feeling noisy.</li>
<li>The candidate system has two layers: manual marks you place and auto-candidates the solver derives. You can flip between them without losing your notes.</li>
<li>The step solver does not just fill cells; it shows the reasoning and keeps a trail so you can walk back through the tactics.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-the-solver-thinks" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#how-the-solver-thinks" class="header-mark"></a>How the solver thinks</h4><p>The solver starts with the basics (naked and hidden singles), then escalates through sets, pointing/claiming, fish, and wing tactics. I wanted the hints to be helpful rather than magical, so each step reports the evidence in plain language.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Porting Asteroids to an ECS with Codex</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Quick version: I rewired my <a href="/games/asteroids/" rel="">Asteroids</a> clone from a pile of classes to an Entity‑Component‑System (ECS). Codex (the CLI agent) did the heavy lifting while I poked, prodded, and occasionally muttered at my screen. The end result is cleaner, easier to extend, and less brittle when I add toys like missiles and sparkly shields.</p>
<p>Why bother with ECS?</p>
<ul>
<li>I was done fighting class hierarchies. I just want to slap “has a shield,” “spins,” or “is a missile” onto things without negotiating with a base class.</li>
<li>Data is data, behavior is behavior. Components hold state; systems do the work over sets of components.</li>
<li>(maybe) Performance as a side effect: tight loops over similar data are fast, but honestly the clarity is what sold me.</li>
<li>New features become “add a component, tweak a system,” not surgery across five files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where I started (a.k.a. the creaky bits)</p>]]></description>
