<h1 id="toc_0">Software, Estimation and the Planning Fallacy</h1>

<p>I always find it interesting that the IT industry borrows so many terms from  Construction; Programmers are called Engineers and Architects, Code is built rather than compiled, we have Planning and Construction phases in delivery models.  In the early days this would have been useful to help form the initial mental model of the roles and processes used to deliver software.  As the industry matured we developed new terms of our own but some older phrases still remain.</p>

<p>Another carry over from the Construction industry is cost estimation, any large project whether it is built with concrete or javascript must have an estimated cost right from the start it seems.  And those estimates are expected to be accurate, statements on various goals such as &ldquo;within 20% of final cost&rdquo; are relatively common.  There is also an expectation for estimates to become more accurate over time.  Like a hunter stalking deer in a deep forest at night, estimators are expected to get better at hitting the mark with practice. But is this a reasonable expectation?</p>

<p>The Sydney opera house<a href="#1">1</a> is one of the most famous budget overruns for any construction project, coming in at a whopping ten years and fourteen times over original estimate, final costs are at around $102M.  But of course that is concrete and steel, surely software doesn&rsquo;t cost as much and is easier to estimate, right?  Not so, Wikipedia keeps a nice list of failed and overbudget software projects<a href="#2">2</a>, here are a few highlights:
- NHS Connecting for Health<a href="#3">3</a> - Estimated at £2.3bn over 3 years, it has so far cost £12.4bn over 10 years.
- Universal Credit<a href="#4">4</a> - Estimated at £2.2bn this was later revised to £12.8bn and again revised to £15.8bn.
- Expeditionary Combat Support System <a href="#5">5</a> - $1.1bn was spent with no significant deliverables, another $1.1bn would need to be invested to even achieve a quarter of original scope.
Those are staggering numbers making the Opera house seem like a bargain at $100M.</p>

<p>Software is still a relatively new industry in comparison to construction, each decade sees major changes in how software is built and how projects are managed e.g. Waterfall to Agile. Humans have been building homes and other structures for centuries yet we still fail to accurately estimate the cost of construction. Why are we so bad at estimating?</p>

<p>Buehler and associates (1995)<a href="#6">6</a> performed a study on a number of students and asked each of them to estimate the dates when they</p>

<p>I have become more involved in the task of software estimation in recent months and have found it to largely be a frustrating experience, one where expectations of accuracy are high.</p>

When I started looking at this I was reminded of something from another interest of mine, history.  Prior to Napoleon wars were relatively smaller affairs with troop numbers limited to around 30K due to economic constraints.  Napoleon was able to gather armies up to 300K-500K men funded a booming french economy.  The scale of the software projects above are beyond the reach of most companies, instead they can only really be funded by healthy nations economy.</p>

<p>I started off by scanning a users profile and recording various pieces of information such as:
- Age in days
- Number of followers
- Number of people followed
- Number of badges received.</p>

<p>I then looped over each of that users followers and recorded the same information,  and then their followers, and then their followers&hellip;  you get the idea.</p>

<p>I ended up thousands of accounts which was good but most of them only had 1 or 2 followers indicating a low level of social integration.  I filtered out most accounts with less than 25 followers (a few did make it in) in order to represent the core social group members.</p>

<p>I graphed the data using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> into a force directed graph that included all of the connections (follows) between each of the gathered members.  There is some gravity applied to the area which results in the larger (more followed) users being drawn towards the center while the smaller users encircle them, like satellites basking in the glow of a shining sun, or hornets buzzing around fresh manure.</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        

<p>While I am working my way through the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D624AQO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00D624AQO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=secretdeveloper-20">Functional Javascript</a> book I came across something that could be really useful, especially when dealing with AJAX requests.</p>

<h4 id="toc_0">Functional Composition</h4>

<p>In a nutshell you start with simple functions that do a single job and then chain them up to perform some larger task.  In this example we want to validate that the json being returned from an AJAX call contains the properties we require.  To do that we start with the following function:</p>

<pre><code>function validator(message, fun){
    var f = function(){
        return fun.apply(fun, arguments);
    };
    f['message'] = message;
    return f;
};
</code></pre>

<p>which takes a message string and a function as parameters and returns an object what can be called with an arbitrary number of arguments to perform a task.  The returned object has a &lsquo;message&rsquo; property assigned also.</p>

<p>Next we need a &lsquo;driver&rsquo; function:</p>

<pre><code>function checker(){  
    var validators = _.toArray(arguments);  
    return function(obj){  
        return _.reduce(validators, function(errs, check){  
            if(check(obj))  
                return errs;  
            else  
                return _.chain(errs).push(check.message).value();  
        }, []);  
    };  
};  
</code></pre>

<p>that should be called with a list of validators as its arguments. It loads these into an array and returns a function which uses this array to validate the object &lsquo;obj&rsquo;. It will loop over each of the validators in the array and checks to see if the obj object passes each of them.  If the check fails then it appends the validators &lsquo;message&rsquo; to the list it will return. If all validators pass then the array returned will be empty.</p>

<h4 id="toc_1">Putting it all together</h4>

<p>I can use my checker and validator functions to create a validation function like the following:</p>

<pre><code>function isValidResourceItem(){
    var validators = checker(

        validator('obj can not be nul',
            function(obj){return !_.isNull(obj);}),

        validator('obj must contain title',
            function(obj){return !_.isNull(obj.title);}),

        validator('obj must contain canonicalVolumeLink',
            function(obj){return !_.isNull(obj.canonicalVolumeLink);}),

        validator('obj must contain description',
            function(obj){return !_.isNull(obj.description);})
    );
    return validators;
};
</code></pre>

<p>which will help to ensure the data was returned in a format I expect and cut down on those &lsquo;undefined&rsquo; errors you would get without something like this.</p>

<h4 id="toc_2">Example</h4>

<p>I reused an example from an earlier jsFiddle to test the idea out, I want to be sure the search results json object contains the properties I need to produce a results list.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/SecretDeveloper/8PqEG/5/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"> </iframe>

<h4 id="toc_3">Whats the point?</h4>

<p>Well I guess it shows an easy way to take pieces of functionality, place them into small reusable functions and build upon them into a pretty powerful set of tools.</p>

<h1 id="toc_0">Knockout.js</h1>

<h3 id="toc_1">Introduction</h3>

<p>A quick and dirty demo to show off a very simple example of what you can do with some knockoutjs code and an AJAX call.  I use the google books API to provide a simple search form.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Show me the Code</h3>

<p>JSFiddle:
<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="http://jsfiddle.net/SecretDeveloper/d9xfP/embedded/" frameborder="0"> </iframe></p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/SecretDeveloper/d9xfP/embedded/result/">jsfiddle</a></p>

<p>I also use the <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">underscore</a> library to work with the observableArray but that is not really a requirement.  I just like it.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">So whats happening?</h3>

<p>We start off by creating a simple html page that contains a text box, a button and a results list. In our javascript file we create a ViewModel object (function) that contains properties that match our html form. It has a field for searchInput, a function to handle searches etc.  In our document ready function we apply this ViewModel to our html using <code>ko.applyBindings(vm);</code>.  When we do this knockoutjs takes our html and resolves all the <code>data-bind=&quot;&quot;</code> attributes we have added to elements and resolves them to fields on our ViewModel.  This is called Model Binding and it is a powerful tool that allows us to have a single ViewModel property displayed in several places on a page, with each kept in sync to any changes.  If the field we are binding to is a <code>ko.observable</code> then any changes made to its value will immediately show wherever it is bound.</p>

<p>We also use a <code>ko.observableArray</code> to hold our search results.  When we initiate a search we make an AJAX call to the appropriate url and then parse the results.  You can see the result structure we receive back by running <code>curl -i https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=potter</code> (where &lsquo;potter&rsquo; is what you want to search for).  Once we receive the result we loop over the returned items and create a new resultItem to contain the information we want.  These items are then added to our array, <code>self.items.push(resultI);</code> which thanks to knockoutjs gets rendered to our results div immediately.  You can see that knockoutjs can iterate over collections by using the <code>foreach:items</code> databinding.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Whats the big deal?</h3>

<p>Well this particular demo is about as easy as it gets, but even so it covers a few important topics:
    - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel">Model View ViewModel</a> pattern.
    - <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-context.html">Model Binding</a> as it applies to Knockout
    - Working with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API">web API&rsquo;s</a> using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>.</p>

<p>It shows what we can achieve with a few lines of code by building upon these powerful libraries.  KnockoutJS is taking care of binding our ViewModel to our html and also updates that html whenever we change an observable. jQuery is handling the AJAX request for us.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Functional javascript using underscore</h2>

<h3 id="toc_1">Why?</h3>

<p>A little while ago I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D624AQO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00D624AQO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=secretdeveloper-20">Functional Javascript</a> by Michael Fogus.  I&rsquo;m only part way through it and to be honest I should probably have waited until I finished it before starting this post but&hellip;</p>

<p>There is a central theme to this book which intrigued me, indeed its one of the main tenets of functional programming.  It can be summed up in this quote:
&gt;&ldquo;It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.&rdquo; - Alan Perlis</p>

<p>This is very different concept to what is normally seen in large enterprise level projects and applications.  I have to say that I have spent a large amount of time writing code to map one model to another and back again. Its not fun. This functional stuff might be on to something.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">What?</h3>

<p>Well Michaels book uses the <a href="http://underscorejs.org">underscore</a> library for all of his examples and its a really powerful tool.  I have started using it here and there on smaller projects and the more I use it the more I like it.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">How?</h3>

<p><a href="http://http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is probably the go-to set of problems when developers try to learn a new language or framework.  I don&rsquo;t see why I should be any different.  I have started a small project to play around with this and you can see it over on <a href="https://github.com/SecretDeveloper/sdjs">github</a>.</p>

<h4 id="toc_4">Problem 1</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can be solved with a few lines of code like the following:
<code>
    return _.reduce(_.range(0,1000), function(memo, number){  
            if( number%3===0 || number%5==0) return memo+number;  
            return memo;}  
        );  
</code></p>

<h4 id="toc_5">Testing</h4>

<p>Unit testing javascript has come a long way in the last few years and I have added a simple QUnit test runner to the repository.</p>
