      <description>Javascript gets some bad press these days especially over how its comparison operators work.
I decided to extend Craig Gidneys example and added ===, !=, !== &amp;lt;, &amp;lt;=, &amp;gt; and .= comparisons.

      <description>Functional javascript using underscore Why? A little while ago I picked up Functional Javascript by Michael Fogus. I&amp;rsquo;m only part way through it and to be honest I should probably have waited until I finished it before starting this post but&amp;hellip;
There is a central theme to this book which intrigued me, indeed its one of the main tenets of functional programming. It can be summed up in this quote: &amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.</description>
