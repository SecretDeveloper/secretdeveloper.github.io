Javascript gets some bad press these days especially over how its comparison operators work. 

I decided to extend [Craig Gidneys](http://strilanc.com/visualization/2014/03/27/Better-JS-Equality-Table.html) example and added ===, !=, !== <, <=, > and .= comparisons. 

Rows are the left side operand and columns are the right.
