# What is this blog about?
This is a playground blog to store some posts written by a guy called Gary Kenneally.  You should follow me on twitter [@secretdeveloper](http://twitter.com/secretdeveloper).  

This blog contains static content generated from a [github repository](https://github.com/SecretDeveloper/secretdeveloper.github.io)

## Development
Programmer, System designer, and Technical Lead on a variety of large enterprise projects and solutions including Websites, Windows Services and large SOA systems. Other than that I play with all sorts of different technologies when I find the time.  Right now I am interested in javascript/ajax/coffeescript/functional programming/knockoutjs/underscore and lots of others.  If I learn something new each day then I am happy.
